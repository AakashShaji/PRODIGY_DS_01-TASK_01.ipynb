Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is . This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

## Tools and Libraries used
* Jupyter notebook
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this EDA process has provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variables in the dataset. Key findings include:

- Summary statistics and distributions of the variables.
- Identification of any outliers or missing data.
- Relationships and correlations between variables.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
